# Enemy Texture Placeholders

The following enemy textures need to be created and placed in `public/assets/items/`:

1. **enemy_penguin.webp** - A penguin enemy texture
   - Suggested: Black and white penguin sprite
   - Size: 128x128 or 256x256 pixels
   
2. **enemy_snowman.webp** - A snowman enemy texture
   - Suggested: White snowman with carrot nose
   - Size: 128x128 or 256x256 pixels
   
3. **enemy_yeti.webp** - A yeti enemy texture
   - Suggested: White furry creature
   - Size: 128x128 or 256x256 pixels

For testing, you can create simple colored squares or use any temporary images.
The enemies will be rendered as billboards (always facing the camera) using the DynamicItemRenderer.
